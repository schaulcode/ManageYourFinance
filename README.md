# ManageYourFinance
Manage your Finance is an application made to register all your financial transactions under one roof. Categorise each of them according to their account, type or payee. You can even use a schedule feature for recurring transactions. And for a clear overall of your finance just benefit of the Income and Expense report. 
Manage your Finance is a project I have developed during my free time. I have written it in C# Asp.NET Framework and used the MVC model. I used the library of Dapper for the connection of the database and mapping. The Database used is MSSql but the app is extendable to support other Database's too.
